It is very likely that, if I had the money to pay for a uterus removing surgery, I would schedule to have that procedure done as soon as possible. That is because, if I have my uterus effectively removed (and I survive the operation without serious medical complications), I would have also made an explicit announcement about it on my public and personal websites (and I would have requested to have the extracted uterus so that I could upload the image of it along with a short video of me setting it on fire and chanting celebratorily about how it is no longer my personal burden (but many of the male apes around me behave as though they personally own my uterus and hence act like I am running away with their stolen property)). 

If any person would like to help me afford a uterus removal procedure, that person may donate money to my business PayPal account via the link in the DONATION_PORTAL section of the home page of Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com.

Most of human civilization appears to me to currently be a human trafficking and human as livestock breeding factory. It seems that most women are too oppressed to resist being institutionalized to have no choice but to marry and sexually reproduce with a man in many parts of the world (though I assume almost all women have the physical ability to run away and fight back (et cetera)).

If all the women extracted their uteruses, then there would be no wombs other than artificial wombs (grown in a laboratory from cultured human stem cells) by which to incubate new human zygotes into fetuses into infants. Meanwhile, existing humans could extend their lifespans and physiological capabilities using modern medicine which is continuously improved through ongoing research and development efforts.

I am afraid women would be a lot less cherished by the men in their lives if such a thing were to happen (but perhaps I'm wrong).

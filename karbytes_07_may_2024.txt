My personal interests should take up most of my time is my personal religion.

I define personal interests as activities pertaining to recreational endeavors, hobbies, and voluntary socialization or voluntary civic participation.

Despite being a citizen of a country in which every citizen is (according to this country's recorded and currently enforced rules) endowed with the immutable ability to control how it expresses itself (in the context of communication, movement, appearance, beliefs, and art production), there is no guarantee that, at any second, I have the means to practice my religion (with or without opposition from people other than myself). 

At the very least, I tell myself every day that I am always figuring stuff out (i.e. learning (even after some of my knowledge is pruned from memory)). That perpetual activity of figuring things out (through empirical observation, logical reasoning, and physical actions) is what I consider to be my default (or baseline) personal interests.

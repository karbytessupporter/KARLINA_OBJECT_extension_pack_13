Questions that I hope to get definitive answers to are as follows:

1. Is there more than one universe throughout all existence (whether those universes are parallel (i.e. simultaneously occurring) or serial (i.e. chronologically non-overlapping)?

2. Will I reincarnate (for some finite or else for an infinite number of times) and/or live forever?

3. Is every imaginable universe inevitable to occur (and can I select to instantiate into only ones which I can honestly say are "comfortably tolerable" instead of what I would deem to be genuinely so painful that I would not want any sentient being to have to suffer through it)?

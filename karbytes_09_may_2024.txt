Yesterday I deleted the web page named PROPOSED_PRINCIPLES_OF_GLOBAL_GOVERNANCE from the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com. 

I did that because I do not (enjoy nor think it is useful for me to attempt) controlling how people other than myself behave. 

(What I said in the previous sentence is related to the belief which I currently have that each human (and, more generally, each information processing agent) is entirely controlled (like a puppet) by factors which that information processing agent does not have awareness of. Approximately twelve hours ago, I felt particularly aware of how machine-like everything in my universe is (including and especially how I make decisions "in real time"). I always seem to feel a constant "momentum" propelling me to take the next action or to secrete the next thought or to render the next sensory phenomenon in my "real time" attention span. Time moving forward from my vantage feels to me like riding a bicycle which never stops moving from one location in space to another. The universe is sort of dragging me around and I seem to have no actual control of how (but I seem to have to pretend that I have "free will" in order to survive and to avoid as much suffering as possible)).

So, now that the aforementioned web page has been relegated to a "legacy" web page instead of an "active" web page within the aforementioned blogging website, I feel compelled (and excused to) stop calling attention (via my public web presence (which is associated with the brand name "karbytes")) to human population concerns (especially "over population"), human sexual reproduction politics, and wealth amongst individual humans. I will let the apes decide for themselves how to manage their properties and how they interact with other apes without my further input.
